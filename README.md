This repository contains 5 files 4 csv files and 1 code file.
The csv files aug_train and aug_test are raw data files that have been preprocessed to obtain the final_train, final_test. All the code associated with the same is present in the code file.
The code file also contains all the code associated with exploratory data analysis and testing of various machine learning algorithms that predict whether a data scientist is going to switch jobs or not.
Different ML algorithms are tested and the one with the best performance is selected as the final model and predictions are obtained.
Training of the ML algorithms is done on the final_train.csv and the final predictions are obtained for the final_test.csv.
